/Users/xiaoyatang/Desktop/2022-Homework/machine-learning/CS6350-ML2022/Decision_tree/submission.py:318: DeprecationWarning: `np.int` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `int`. To silence this warning, use `int` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. When replacing `np.int`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.
